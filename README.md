# ProteusAI
ProteusAI is a library for the machine learning driven engineering of proteins. The library enables workflows from protein structure prediction, prediction of mutational effects to protein ligand interactions powered by artificial intelligence. The goal is to provide state of the art machine learning models in a central library.
